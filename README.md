 # Health Assist Pro
## Summary 
We have made a health assistant, in which when the symptoms of the ailment are put, it gives the disease, medications, precautions, description, workouts, and doctor's reviews and their rating.
This is the development of the project as of now.  However, I intend to integrate the multiple language support and search by picture and video options as a part of future work. I also intend to integrate it on  a production-grade, user-friendly web app.
